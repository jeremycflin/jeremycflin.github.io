It’s poison because miles of old idling trucks belch diesel exhaust into the sky every day, filling the lungs of those who live nearby, usually poor communities. Child asthma rates soar and life expectancy plummets. Los Angeles and Long Beach, the two busiest ports in the country, decided to do something about it in 2007.</p>

		      	<p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">The Clean Air Action Plan was the first significant piece of regulation introduced to the trucking industry since 1980. The ports required all companies to replace their drayage fleet -- clunkers a breath away from the junkyard -- with new models. But retrofitting some 10,000 trucks at about $110,000 each was no simple task. Most companies, while in support of the clean trucks, were not willing (or able) to pay for them. Who, then, would come to bear the burden of clean air?</p>

		    	<p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">Congress met in 2010 to see just how the harbor had fared and what became of independent contractors in the California dray.</p>

        		<p><span class="firstcharacter">M</span>AY 2010 -- “We are called independent contractors, but all we are is employees with expenses,” Jose Covarrubias testified, waving a petition with more than 600 drivers’ signatures. He was in a suit, behind a microphone, at the end of a panel with other men in suits behind microphones. “Our bosses tell this lie so they can make us pay for the company trucks.” The bosses to his left looked forward.</p>

	        	<p>The congressional subcommittee’s duty of the day was an assessment of the two-year-old environmental initiative at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, a plan that had since been tentatively adopted by New Jersey, New York, Seattle, and Tacoma; five of the country’s busiest port cities. All eyes were on California.</p>

		        <p>Ports had become the trucking industry’s notorious hospice, where trucks with two million miles on the odometer could make short drives through the dray with little risk. Emissions in Los Angeles and Long Beach had accounted for 21,000 early deaths, 190,000 sick days and 360,000 school absences every year, according to the California Air Resources Board. The American Journal of Public Health linked 9 percent of childhood asthma cases to the harbor. Not to mention what it’s done to dockworkers and drivers.</p>

		        <p>Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who ran on cleaning L.A.’s air, pulled together a team of experts and harbor commissioners to draft the Clean Air Action Plan. The basic goal: phase out the old trucks for cleaner new ones without devastating production.</p>

		        <p>Economist John Husing, one of the plan’s architects commissioned by the Harbor Trucking Association, came on to forecast the environmental plan’s financial impact. His job was twofold: clean the air and maintain efficiency. But he knew then that nobody inside the industry -- not companies and certainly not drivers -- could realistically absorb some $800 million in retrofits. More than 10,000 trucks needed to be replaced by $110,000 ones. “Given the weakened state of the sector,” Husing writes, “it seems almost impossible for the rules to be set in way that none of the players will be hurt.” The Teamsters slid into the conversation with reform: Make all of the independent contractors employees of their company, that way the cost won’t fall on individuals. This became known as the “employee mandate.”</p>

				<p>Husing was not himself prepared to dive into the deep end of a decades-long labor war. “That issue is a pressure cooker,” he said later. “You’re always going to piss somebody off.”</p>

		        <p>The five-year, $2 billion Clean Air Action Plan hit the harbor in 2007. The American Trucking Association promptly sued the city of Los Angeles. But not over the clean trucks. Just the employee mandate. The industry, backed by other stakeholders, from Target to the shipping lines, argued: federal legislation from the Motor Carrier’s Act prohibits the government from standardizing any trade industry. It’s anti-competitive and bad for business. The “patchwork regulatory structure,” the Chamber of Commerce said, would effectively undermine the free market encouraged by deregulation.</p>

		        <p>While the employee mandate jostled around the courts for four years, the environmental bit went on ahead, forcing an “existential decision” across the industry, as one company owner described it. How to drive brand new trucks without paying for them?</p>

  				<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>wo years after he signed -- “They told me I could only work there if I signed a lease” -- Covarrubias quit his job driving at the port. He had fallen behind on his mortgage, and the bank foreclosed. And because he was never an employee, he didn’t qualify for unemployment insurance. He moved his wife and three daughters into a two-bedroom apartment, dropping the dog off at the pound on the way.</p>

		        <p>Covarrubias quit because he received a paycheck from Southern Counties Express for $96. Then, the next week: negative $200. He owed his company money for failing to turn enough containers. Covarrubias’ company disputed his work hours. Successful contractors, companies argue, just work longer hours than the bad ones. “It depends on the individual,” one president said, “how hard he’s willing to work.” It’s the free market ethos born in 1981. But “this was not a free market,” said Fred Potter of the Teamsters. “He is captive.”</p>

		        <p>Potter called the model “sharecropping-on-wheels,” forcing drivers like Covarrubias to choose food for their family or truck maintenance. Joe Rajkovacz, then regulatory director at the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, is a longtime champion of independent contractors in trucking (and vocal critic of the Teamsters.) But even he said these agreements are “rent-to-own schemes,” “involuntary servitude” that “makes the payday loan industry look ethical.”</p>

		        <p>The language in the leases is ubiquitous across the industry: Drivers pay a flat lease rate every week (regardless of productivity), expenses on the truck, and insurance that only covers approved routes (so they can’t drive for another company). The company removes those deductions from their weekly check. Drivers are still paid by container and dispatched routes by the company, with no customer interaction -- some are fined for missing a container quota. Still on a 1099.</p>

			    <p>The ATA offered a 20 percent subsidy to the industry. But none of the lease agreements reviewed for this article suggested how, if at all, that subsidy might be passed on to the drivers.

Several of the leases stipulate that, should a driver break the contract, he’s on the hook for the remaining balance. “This would be totally coercive,” Nadler said, “Would it not be?” Digges conceded that much, “under the strict terms of your question.” DeFazio and others promised to subpoena the companies, investigate the lease agreements, and return to the issue after some of the confusion cleared.</p>

  				<p>Later that year, in 2010, the democrats lost the House majority. Port truck drivers haven’t come up again since. No investigations were launched or subpoenas issued from the subcommittee. “It was quite a show, though,” Rajkovacz later said, “Wasn’t it?”</p>

		        <p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>CTOBER 2015 -- About two dozen men walked in circles on a sun-splashed sidewalk. The union provided the tents, vests, transportation, burritos and picket signs: “We are all employees.” At one point, a maintenance man came outside with a ladder and hung a large white sign on the building’s south face: “XPO Logistics Owner-Operators Wanted.” They laughed at that, and continued to march in tight circles.</p>

		        <p>This was a Teamsters-organized event, one of many held, in concert, across the dray. The union has been trying to organize port drivers for decades, but only began seeing success in the wake of the clean air program. Those on both sides have described it as “an awakening.”</p>

		        <p>One of the strikers was Julio Garcia, a 54-year-old union hopeful with soft features, two kids and a sick wife who may need surgery (“right now, we’re keeping our fingers crossed and we are sticking to natural remedies.”) One study estimated that 90 percent of drayage drivers in the San Pedro complex don’t have health insurance of any kind for their family. Though, today, many may qualify for Medi-Cal if they report a low enough income.</p>

			  	</div>
			</div>

  			
  			<div class="veryNarrow center-element section">
		        <p>Garcia, who has a wage claim pending with the labor commissioner, became involved in the misclassification campaign for a father’s reasons: health benefits, college savings for his kids, and a retirement plan. He also hopes to one day own a home. Like most of the port truck drivers now involved with the union campaign, Garcia said he was duped into thinking this job was a ticket to the middle class. “But in reality,” he said, “it’s all a farce and they are just lies fed to people like us.”</p>

		      	<p>His company, XPO Logistics, has been an unwilling center of attention in port trucking, an industry it only last year got into after two big ticket acquisitions, namely Pacer Cartage and Harbor Rail Transit, both of which drew up lease agreements after the clean air program. It’s no secret the union and nonprofits have targeted the biggest dog in the yard.</p>

		      	<p>The union’s communications and research partner is called the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. LAANE has offices above Teamster Local 848 in Long Beach. Most from the industry have criticized the Teamster’s involvement and LAANE’s role as union recruitment efforts under the guise of labor justice. “To their credit,” said Weston LaBar, president of the Harbor Trucking Association, “it’s the best organizing effort they’ve had since the 1980s.”</p>

		      	<p>“The truth is 80 percent [of independent contractors] resist being organized,” he said, referring to John Husing’s oft-cited driver survey conducted before the Clean Trucks Program flipped the industry on its head. (That figure comes from 32 percent of independent contractors responding that they would be unwilling to become an employee; 48 percent undecided.) The industry says small strikes like this one at XPO show that these are just unhappy campers, a loud minority handed a Teamsters megaphone. “This is your typical union bullying,” LaBar said.</p>

		      	<p>Labor advocates argue that the numbers don’t back that up: Of the some-800 individual claims filed with the labor commissioner, “we’ve been involved with maybe 100,” Kaoosji said. Of the 25 class action lawsuits, “we’ve been involved with two.”</p>

		      	<p>“It's not the Union running around lighting things on fire,” he added. "It's really on the companies to say, ‘What did we do to cause this?’”</p>

		      	<p class="caption">The longshoremen take breaks throughout the day. So every day, for much of the afternoon, trucks wait in a line that can back up for miles, into the city and onto the freeways. The 7th Street Terminal in Oakland is especially crowded around lunchtime.</p>

		      	<p>The motivation behind the groundswell -- whether it’s organic (a Marxist sort of class consciousness) or labor organized -- may seem ancillary. But companies say that’s an important consideration when deciding how to respond. Either way; the hour has come. Almost 10 percent of truck drivers at the two biggest ports in the country are suing their bosses, for one reason or another. Smaller companies say that switching to employees isn’t practical, even if they wanted to. It would take a large player on the market -- like XPO -- to move the needle and realign prices to accommodate the new costs to companies. As is, the small companies don’t have leverage with retailers or shippers because the field is too competitive.</p>

			    <p>Gordon Devens, XPO’s chief legal officer, said for XPO to consider abandoning independent contractors on the waterfront, the company would have to first be convinced that a significant number of drivers is actually dissatisfied with their status as such. “They’ll have to vote with their feet.”</p>

			    <p>But right now, feet seem to be shuffling at XPO.</p>

			    <p>One of the biggest logistics outfits in the world, XPO is the only publicly held enterprise at the ports. A $4 billion company, XPO has 84,000 employees at 1,450 locations in 32 different countries. But in the dray, Devens said, it’s just another name on the side of a truck, a big fish in a big pond.</p>

			    <p>The industry expert said the company does not issue leases anymore, and he thinks many of the preexisting ones are coming to term. Still, he defends the impetus behind them. “[XPO] wanted to preserve [its] business and preserve their [the drivers'] business,” he said, speaking to the leases XPO inherited in the wake of the Clean Air Program. “[The company] fronted the cost of the trucks.”</p>

  				<p class="long-quote">“With the regulation and economic reality, [XPO] felt that it had no choice. It's a funny thing because that fact has been used against [them] in several of these suits. It’s sort of under the heading of no good deed goes unpunished.”</p>

		        <p>Like most after 2008, Pacer Cartage, now XPO’s subsidiary, created an internal finance company as part of its new leasing program, effectively becoming a financier for drivers without good enough credit to lease a truck on their own. The driver leased from this new company, on paper, and then leased the title back to Pacer.</p>

		        <p>Pacer’s program was so confusing that the court had trouble deciphering who actually owned the trucks: “Pacer International set up a company known as CTP which leased the trucks from Bank of America. CTP then leased the trucks to the drivers who in turn leased it to Pacer. Drivers never saw the master lease between Bank of America and CTP. Only two of the drivers had graduated high school and none spoke English very well and really did not understand the nature of the agreement.” The lease agreements, thick as bricks, were in English.</p>

		        <p>The drivers had no ownership over the equipment, the tool needed to perform a job on which the company depended. If CTP was late on payments to the bank, the truck could be repossessed from the driver, even if he kept his end of the deal.</p>

		        <p>The court went through an itemized list of control factors, the “economic realities test,” to measure which party -- driver or company -- had leverage in the relationship. Testimonies revealed that there were “consequences for refusing a load;” The trucks had mileage limits and container quotas; Violating either resulted in a fine and “remedial training;” The company’s insurance only covered company-approved routes -- a driver couldn't drive for another company; And rent was a flat rate to be paid regardless of how much he made.</p>

  				<p>Every individual misclassification hearing and court case uses a complex matrix of factors because no all-inclusive definition of “employee” can be applied in broad strokes. The IRS has a different definition than the National Labor Relations Board, for instance. But they’re all vague enough to invite interpretation at every step. Just because this port truck driver is misclassified, doesn't mean they all are. Nonetheless, in sectors spread as thin as logistics, certain industries feel comfortable abandoning employees all together.</p>

			     <p>“I’ve tried to address subcontracting, which changes the competitive dynamics,” Wage and Hour Division Administrator David Weil said. His bureau is charged with enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act nationally. Today’s climate “creates incentives to cut costs -- cut labor costs and not comply.

  				<p>The court upheld the labor commissioner's judgement of about $300,000 to each driver in February. XPO has since appealed again, this time to the state Supreme Court.</p>

		      	<p>Each case can seem like a windfall unto itself: after a driver establishes the misclassification, by law they are entitled to expenses taken from their weekly check, in addition to overtime and pay for rest breaks, which is why some of the assessments are so high. XPO takes issue with “the measure of damages” awarded.  “We can accept their conclusion that the contractors are employees,” Devens said. “We don’t agree with it, but it doesn’t really matter what we think there. But the measure of damages simply doesn’t make sense.” He said the labor commissioner is essentially double dipping, reimbursing drivers for expenses for which they were already compensated.</p>

		      	<p>David Gurley, a labor commissioner attorney who works exclusively on these cases, said that argument has come up and fallen down in court. The defense hasn’t proven adequate compensation was made. Gurley said the big awards are not meant to be “a message to the industry.” Rather, “it’s a straight legal analysis to what they’re entitled to under the law.”</p>

		      	<p>The drivers on strike in front of XPO that Friday thought they’re entitled to something. XPO may not be issuing more leases, but much of its workforce in the dray is still tied to ones from years ago, still holding on to hope that they may one day own it. They’re quick to pull out pay stubs and show you a long list of deductions pulled from their paycheck every week. “It’s very frustrating,” Julio Garcia said. “It leaves you feeling desperate.”</p>


		      	<p>The strike ended, somewhat abruptly, as planned: drivers can’t afford multiple days off. The union’s van pulled up to pack up the tent and signs. Before they left, the drivers walked back into the building -- the Teamsters were not allowed in -- and signed a work continuation agreement. They’d be driving again Monday.</p>
