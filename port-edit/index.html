		      	<p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">Along with the rest of the trucking sector, their industry was deregulated in the 80s. Hundreds of thousands of truckers, mostly poor, mostly immigrant, flooded the market, increasing competition while driving down shipping costs -- along with truckers’ wages and working conditions. As a cost-saving measure, companies took advantage of this cheap, high-turnover fleet by labeling their drivers independent contractors instead of employees.</p>

		    	<p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">But, for the most part, those driving in the dray have never enjoyed the freedom of being a contractor, nor the benefits of being an employee. Their trucks bottleneck at the harbor, fanning out for miles in a labyrinth of gridlock, burning gas and money while they crawl toward a city of containers. The plight of port truck -- “drayage” -- drivers has gone largely unnoticed for decades, written off as a necessary casualty of globalization.</p>

		        <p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">Then a bit of regulation, a clean air policy, came back to the country’s two largest ports and awakened 90,000 drivers around the country. The industry, now regularly besieged with labor violation claims and expensive litigation, has slipped the bill by setting up paper companies and walking away in bankruptcy court, leaving millions in unpaid wages on the table.</p>

		        <p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">This is the story of how a universal business model turned toxic on the waterfront, bringing a vital logistics industry to its knees.</p>

        		<p><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>ECEMBER 2015 -- “What do you mean he’s having a heart attack?” Christy Hernandez asked the doctor with the clipboard.</p>

	        	<p>“Your father is having a heart attack,” he repeated, slower this time. She looked at her 65-year-old dad on the white hospital bed, calm as ever, taking in most of the conversation. He sure didn’t seem like someone with a 90 percent-clog in one of his heart’s arteries, and another closing fast.</p>

		        <p>“What do you do for a living?” the doctor asked. This was his first time at the St. John’s hospital in Oxnard, about 45 minutes north of Los Angeles, since being diagnosed with diabetes a decade ago. His blood pressure had shot up over the past few days.</p>

		        <p>“I drive a truck at the ports,” Israel Hernandez replied in okay English.</p>

		        <p>He also lived in a truck at the ports, five nights a week for almost 20 years, hauling containers 14 hours a day back and forth from the dockyard to warehouses -- a short stretch of the logistics network known as “the dray.” He slept in his cab, strummed a guitar, and ate from taco trucks. He had just returned from a six-day stretch at the port of Long Beach when he felt his chest tighten that December morning.</p>

		        <p>Before Medicare kicked in on his most recent birthday, Hernandez didn’t have access to regular health care, even though he worked full-time at a massive logistics company -- in one of the country’s least healthy professions.</p>

		        <p>“If this happened a year before,” Christy said, “he wouldn’t have had the the coverage because he didn’t have healthcare through work.”</p>

		        <hr>


		        <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>hat work -- the work of truck drivers in the dray -- is at the center of a national labor fight in the often invisible world of supply chain logistics. Thousands of drivers, including Hernandez, have sued their bosses for back wages and benefits owed on the basis of employee misclassification. But most -- even the successful ones -- have yet to see their circumstances change. Tiny cogs in global trade, drayage drivers face the formidable lobbying and legal power of national trucking associations, shipping conglomerates and retail chains dependent on the system as is.</p>

		        <p>The Investigative Reporting Program interviewed more than 70 drivers, companies, and experts and reviewed thousands of pages in labor commissioner records, court documents, studies and government data. It found that most of the $12 billion port trucking industry has cut labor costs for decades by not employing any of its drivers. As a result, most are working at least 60 hours a week and many take home less than minimum wage, with no recourse or bargaining power. They have no health insurance, pension or worker’s compensation. That’s their choice as independent contractors, according to the companies.</p>

		        <p>But records in California -- home to the country’s number one, two and five ports -- show the labor commissioner and appeals courts have unanimously disagreed: they are employees. The state has levied $22.3 million against almost 60 different companies on behalf of 300 individual drivers so far; plus thousands more pending as class action lawsuits and wage claims not yet processed. The Teamsters union has backed hundreds of these claims while organizing protests at different companies along the waterfront.</p>


		        <p>There are about 75,000 more drivers all over the country in similar positions. But because the entire industry is built on this model of non-employment -- not unlike that of Uber -- companies can’t afford to change now, let alone pay years of back wages. Taking on the labor costs of an employee fleet is a dangerous proposition in the hyper-competitive port trucking market, where margins are razor-thin.</p>

		        <p>The West Coast waterfront became the entire industry’s fault line after a well-intentioned environmental policy came to a head last year. The IRP found that a complex leasing program permeated hundreds of different California port trucking companies overnight in 2007. The industry bought rigs then rented them out with the promise of ownership. The leases tether driver to truck to company, without the benefits, pay or stability of traditional employment. If you walk or get sick, like Hernandez, those years of lease payments vanish. The balance goes back to zero and another driver takes your seat.</p>

		        <p>Some have testified to 80-hour weeks for $75 checks, paying leases for a truck they could never really own. Others have had to pay their bosses after a slow week. Companies withhold payment, solicit bribes and coerce drivers into paying the costs of running the business. “Independent contractor agreements signed by its drivers,” one hearing officer said, “can be and is often a subterfuge to avoid paying payroll and income taxes.”</p>

		        <p>The IRP found that less than 10 percent of successful wage claims in port trucking have been paid out, a chronic symptom of backlog at the state’s embattled labor commissioner, coupled with the industry’s many escape routes. Some of the awards are so high that companies can’t afford to honor them -- as much as $300 thousand per driver in some cases. The state government doesn’t have the legal authority or manpower for sweeping policy change to help drivers before they need to sue their bosses. “It’s never been [our] intent to reclassify,” said Edna Garcia Earley, a lawyer with the labor commissioner. “We just want them to properly classify their workers under the law.”</p>

		        <p>But most companies have avoided the law through settlements, while others have rolled the cases through years of frivolous appeals. Some have skirted the labor commissioner altogether through shell companies and bankruptcy court.</p>

		        <p>Drivers in the California dray are still under the terms of the lease contract, even though their contracts have since been found illegal under labor law; still unpaid for expenses they never should have incurred to begin with; and still working under conditions labor activists have called akin to “sharecropping,” “serfdom” and “indentured servitude.”</p>

  				<p class="long-quote">“I am a believer in free markets,” an L.A. judge said after a company appealed a labor commissioner's decision. “This was not a free and open market.”</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="veryNarrow section center-element">
  				<p>Other major port cities have similar programs, but not the legal or political climate to do much about it. Likewise, the federal government has been slow to step in with policy reform because of the trucking sector’s of insulation and deregulation, going back to the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, when companies shifted to independent contractors -- also called “owner operators” -- to cut costs and remain competitive.</p>

        		<p>An employee is protected under the Fair Labor Standards Act, entitled to minimum wage, overtime, unemployment insurance, rest and lunch breaks, worker’s comp, health benefits and collective bargaining. An independent contractor sacrifices those labor liberties for the flexibility of being a small business owner. You can choose jobs as you please, negotiate contracts and work longer hours to earn a better living.</p>

			     	 <p class="imgQuote" id="jesseQuote">“This business makes you away from your family, my two daughters. I learned the hard way. Eight years I struggled.”<span class="interview">Jesse Zuniga, employee port truck driver in Oakland, California.</span></p>
			  	</div>
			</div>
			<div class="veryNarrow section center-element">
  				<p>“It’s not the American dream they sell you,” said Jesse Zuniga, a driver in the Port of Oakland. It’s something closer to “a nightmare.” A chef once, Zuniga drove as an independent contract for seven years, scraping by around minimum wage. His company Shippers Transport Express switched to an employee business model in a lawsuit settlement. He still beats himself up for not having the money to keep his oldest daughter in college. She had to drop out because money was too tight. “I wasn’t there to help her out,” he said, crying over the phone, “to help her succeed.”</p>

		        <p>The Shippers Transport operations manager in Oakland, Guy Sanderson, said guys like Zuniga are the exception, not the rule. The class action suit that forced the company to change its model was the result of “one driver that was pissed off at the world,” he said. “Most weren’t happy it changed over.” Sanderson only started leasing trucks only after they agreed to the terms, that they wanted to keep driving as independent contractors: “You should know owner operators want to stay one and that's a fact.”</p>

		        <p>In most areas of trucking, like long-haul, independent contractors often thrive. But in the dray, where containers are the currency, you won’t find small business owners. You’ll usually see thousands of idling trucks, 90,000 Hernandezes behind the wheel nationwide, stuck single file outside terminals, waiting to pick up an anonymous container, hopefully two a day. “Everything,” one congressman said, “conspires against the people actually driving the rigs, which is why I can understand why people don’t want to have employees” paid hourly. Drayage truckers don’t make deals with customers or bargain for business. They don’t even know what they’re hauling most of the time. Mayonnaise some days. Gardening supplies, transmissions, trash. Cell phones and jet parts.</p>

       			 <p>The global logistics network is a complex web of tiny, moving parts, each dependent on one another like the wheels inside a watch. Billions rely on it for their everyday life; millions for their livelihood. Ports are economic engines, job-producers, all over the world, especially in California.</p>

		        <p>The largest port in the country, Los Angeles -- often called “America’s port -- combines with the adjoining second largest port in Long Beach to form the San Pedro complex, which spans 68 miles of waterfront. It’s an industrial jungle with a canopy of containers and cranes piercing the sky, thousands of trucks crawling below.</p>

		        <p>San Pedro handles 40 percent of the country’s trade, some 6.5 million 40-foot containers every year, each holding anywhere from $30,000 to $300,000 worth of cargo inside. More than half of the container traffic comes from China, which traded $134 billion in goods with the Port of Los Angeles alone last year. Japan and South Korea are a distant second and third. But megaships from every corner of the planet, from Mumbai to Helsinki, pull in and out every day to drop containers onto the backs of trucks on the California coast.</p>

		        <p>Independent contractors at the ports (also called owner-operators) aren’t registered with the Department of Transportation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't track them. And the IRS has a tentative idea of how much they actually make versus what they report on the 1099s their companies give them. Drayage drivers can’t contract or negotiate with the shipping companies at sea or retailers on land, the people who own the container. The dispatcher on the other end of the radio -- often a phone app, now -- is the closest they come to the customer. They’re invisible.</p>

		        <p>“They toil up to 18 hours a day, six days a week without uninterrupted meal or rest breaks for poverty-level wages,” one nonprofit labor lawyer said in bankruptcy court, where his firm is chasing down a rogue company trying to abscond through shell companies. “These drivers are trapped in a cycle of labor exploitation and abuse because they have been misclassified as independent contractors.”</p>

		        <p>At best, these companies, some 5,000 wide (800 operating in L.A. and Long Beach), fell victim to the downward pressures of an unregulated free market and globalization’s inefficiencies, were misled by confusing labor laws, and forced into difficult decisions just to stay afloat. At worst, the industry exploits and coerces a vulnerable, uneducated labor force into bearing the costs of those inefficiencies, while stripping away workers’ rights as they founder like feudal serfs.</p>

		        <p>One congressman described it as the prisoner’s paradox, where both driver and company “are engaging in irrational behavior” because of the competitive nature of the market. Given the economic and legal climate, the system benefits a shrinking percentage of companies and even less drivers -- though a rare few on both sides have found ways to succeed amid a field of failure. So who actually benefits?</p>

			  		<p>“You mean besides from you and me, and everyone else who buys stuff from stores?” said Kristen Monaco, a division chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She spent her previous career conducting academic surveys of the trucking industry, with a particular interest in independent contractors at the ports. “And the interests who like the setup the way it is also spend a lot of time talking to people on the Hill as well.” The status quo has long benefited international commerce: independent contractors cost less to move containers.</p>

			        <p>Big retailers cut deals with international shipping conglomerates -- monoliths on two ends of the supply chain. They negotiate a “door price,” and every atomized link between, from drayage drivers and warehouse pickers, to seafarers and longshoremen, gets a slice. Consumers in the age of Amazon create pressure at the shelf-level, and that pressure flows down and down until it hits the floor, where a landscape of low-wage, immigrant workers have no leverage or bargaining power. No recourse. “Of all the global trade related logistics workers,” sociologist Edna Bonacich said, “port truckers are the most oppressed.”</p>

			        <p><span class="firstcharacter">C</span>hristy gets on her dad about the pills. He forgets to take them sometimes. But he’s conscientious, diligent about dabbing the corners of his mouth with a napkin every couple minutes. Boca bien? he asks her. When recounting his story, a life of hard work and poverty, he speaks with steady clarity. The one time he did cry, though, he made a point to shield his face from Christy, who handed him another napkin.</p>

			        <p>When he first came here, Hernandez worked in the fields for years, sleeping in a one-room addition with a dozen others. He started making real money -- $4 an hour -- when he got promoted to an Oxnard packinghouse, where he drove a forklift carrying lemons. On the weekends, he sold near-spoiled fruit at a flee market in downtown L.A.</p>

			        <p>One day in the late 80s, he heard a commercial on the radio looking for local truck drivers: “The open road awaits you.” He enrolled in a free, 8-week class at a local community college. Through the Harbor Trucking Association, drayage companies co-sponsor these programs in Southern California to “assist graduates with placement within [the] HTA partner network of local drayage companies.”</p>

			        <p>Hernandez saved up enough cash (literally under his mattress) to buy his first truck, a white 1996 Peterbilt. “I finally felt like I wasn’t poor anymore,” he said. Christy remembers playing in her dad’s second home when he parked it outside the house.</p>

			        <p>Two weeks after his heart attack last winter, just a day before he planned on getting back into his truck, Hernandez collapsed while getting up from bed to go to the bathroom. Stroke. He’s alive, but he’ll never drive a truck again. Out of work and without a pension or retirement fund -- the money has dried up. He is poor again.</p>

			        <h1 class="section_titles">Fall of the Teamsters,<br> Rise of the 1099</h1>

			        <p><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>ECEMBER 2015 -- Carol Cauley’s two sons raised themselves in Savannah, about 30 minutes from the harbor -- their grandmother helped. Cardboard covers the broken windows in their low-slung white home with chipped paint, sitting in a row of the same. “My starter home is my home now,” she said once. Cauley tries to stop by on her way back from the port around dinner time, parking her truck right there on the street. Whenever she’s home for more than a few hours, though, she sleeps.</p>

			        <p>Like Hernandez, Cauley got her license and training at a community college program. She’s hauled Home Depot supplies for C&K Trucking for 11 years. Now she sits behind the wheel for 70 hours a week, often shooting way over Department of Transportation compliance. Sometimes she needs to bribe the dispatcher to get a good container, one with a nearby destination that’s ready to go off the dockyard. “If you log correctly and drive safe,” she said, “then you don’t feed your family.” She said she nets as little as $15,000 on the year.</p>

			        <p>All over the country, dray drivers are in a similar situation as Cauley: most, if not all of their time and money tied up in a truck. They drive for the same company every day. In a 2009 study from the University of North Florida, 98 percent of the independent contractors surveyed in Jacksonville indicated they were “not allowed to work for other firms.” The author of that study summarized his respondent’s general sentiment about the industry in two words: “It sucks.”</p>

		        <p>The National Economic Law Project, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy firm, estimates that 82 percent of the country’s 100,000 port truck drivers are classified as independent contractors. NELP analyzed a dozen different academic surveys of some 2,100 drivers, placing their median net earnings around $29,000 per year, working an average of 59 hours a week -- or about $8.80 an hour. (It’s important to note that the NELP report was in part sponsored by LAANE, a labor activist group that works closely with the Teamsters. But several independent surveys before and after have found similar data.)</p>

		        <p>What was once considered a sub-sector in a classic American industry, blue-collar work for middle class income, has since fallen into a sad state of disrepair. Many drivers today are asking themselves: What happened to the job?</p>

		        <p>Since 1980, port trucking has drawn the working poor in droves, a lasting consequence of the Carter Administration’s economic deregulation. The Motor Carrier Act -- really more of a detariffing measure -- lifted mandatory licenses, rate scales and routes. It let retailers and shippers compare companies and take the best deals in a market that previously had strict rules for who could and couldn’t operate where. Freight movement became a buyer’s paradise.</p>
		        
		        <p>Deregulation tore down barriers to entry across trucking, dismantling the Teamsters while marshaling in waves of new drivers, mostly uneducated immigrants. In Los Angeles, 94 percent of drivers are hispanic, 89 percent foreign born, and about 70 percent have only a high school diploma or less. Every port has its own ethnic profile of truck drivers: Hispanics are the majority at every California port, with a large Sikh and Vietnamese population in the northern cities like Oakland; Ethiopians and Somalis in Seattle and Tacoma; Puerto Ricans, Hispanics and Eastern Europeans in New York; African Americans in Savannah and Jacksonville.</p>

        		<p>As a white woman, Cauley is a statistical unicorn in the dray. She said she spent the early years just proving herself among the men, fighting for containers, while trying to save up enough to move her sons out of the projects. In another life, she had dreamt of being a wedding caterer. But at the time, 10 years ago, port trucking seemed like the quickest way to turn things around. And it was way easier to get into than dental hygiene school.</p>
        
		        <p>After deregulation, the number of truck drivers nationwide grew to 2.9 million, a 75 percent jump, between 1973 and 1995, even as real wages fell by 21 percent in that same period. People like Hernandez and Cauley could take a class, and climb behind the wheel. Teamster membership fell from 55 to 25 percent, and concentrated into niches away from the dray. The dipping cost in freight movement invited rapid expansion of offshoring and global trade, creating a feedback loop: more trade requires more drivers who, in turn, encourage cheaper trade.</p>

		        <p>Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said it’s the exact kind of environment that invites the most vulnerable into an unstable workforce. </p>

		        <p>“The trick here,” he said, “is that many people that have these jobs -- whether they are Uber drivers, beauticians, or truck drivers -- are very happy to have the jobs. But they are happy to have the jobs because the job market is so bleak, particularly for people with limited education. They don’t know that in another time, another era, they would have full time jobs  probably with benefits and all of the labor protections that go along with them. So the question, ‘Are you happy with what you have?’ really is almost a meaningless question absent a fair comparison to what somebody like them used to have, or could have if the law were interpreted in ways that gave them a full time job.”</p>

		        <p>Deregulation had a noble impetus, encouraged by liberals and conservatives alike: stave runaway inflation from the 70s and provide more supply-chain jobs in low-income communities, via competition and international trade. Port trucking, for instance, could now offer work for urban families (unlike most of trucking they drive in a fixed location by the harbor.) “Despite these high hopes,” Rutgers economist and port trucking expert David Bensman explains, “deregulation wrecked the drayage industry:”</p>

  				<p class="long-quote">“New companies entered the industry, hiring their drivers non-union. Established companies faltered. Some went non-union, others went out of business. The firms that triumphed established a new business model. They sold all or most of their trucks to the drivers, then contracted with them on a per-load basis. The emerging independent contracting model meant trucking companies had few fixed costs, had no responsibility for workers’ compensation or unemployment insurance fund contributions, paid no social security taxes, and were able to obtain drivers’ services without paying for health care costs or pension plan.”</p>

		        <p>The dray spread particularly thin while global trade expanded during the retail boom of the 90s. “While deregulation of trucking has negatively impacted working conditions for many truck drivers,” another study notes, “it is the ‘drayers’ who face the most severe circumstances.””</p>

		        <p>In the vast San Pedro complex (Los Angeles and Long Beach combined) 85 percent of drayage companies have less than 100 drivers, and 87 percent use exclusively owner operators who file 1099s. Those owner operators are considered their own little companies working for slightly larger little companies. Drivers average about 11 hours a day, with somewhere between five and eight hours spent waiting; 95 percent reported no pension or retirement plan, only 10 percent have health insurance. The median income is $25,000. Those numbers are consistent with New York, home to the country’s third largest port, where David Bensam found independent contractors earned an average of $28,000 for 60 hours of work per week. Likewise in Seattle, Atlanta, and most other port cities academics have studied.</p>

		        <p>Independent contractors in the dray have no say in the cost of their services. Unlike the longshoremen (the labor aristocracy at the port), port truck drivers are non-employees, all offering the same service, in a field with close to 100 percent turnover. Port trucking companies -- and port cities -- underbid one another, racing to the bottom for shipping-retail contracts.</p>

		        <p class="caption">Containers stack in towers at dockyards. It often takes the longshoremen four or five moves to find each one. Truck drivers need to find and fit their own chassis. Containers get lost. Every inefficiency contributes to port congestion.</p>

		        <p>Belzer said that government institutions, especially financial agencies, have failed to adjust to the flux of the open market at a logistical chokepoint, letting people like Carol Cauley fall through the cracks. “Frankly,” he explained, “the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed with that in mind, to find a way to put a floor under the market to keep people from undercutting each other in the completely unregulated market.” The dray might be that floor for the rest of logistics, but right now it’s falling out beneath its truck drivers.</p>

		        <p>Cauley missed her youngest boy’s Thanksgiving lunch at school this year because she was working. Most Christmases they go to a Savannah homeless shelter in lieu of gift-giving. The hours away from her kids and the poverty wages have broken her. “You should be able to work eight hours a day, Monday through Friday and take care of your family,” she said. “If you work eight hours a day out here, you go broke.” </p>

		        <p>“We fill the shelves at the store but we can’t fill our pantries with food.”</p>
